# SideBarKit

> Plug and play modular SideBar for macOS / iPad

## Description
SideBarKit enables apps to decouled generic sidebar implementation from app code. Less code in the app makes it easier to manage

## Features:
- Toggleable groups (hide/show)
- Reactive tag labels (count change reactivly)
- Dark/Light mode support
- BYO (Bring your own) enum models
- Works for iOS (iPad) and macOS

## Todo:
- Add better ForEach loops (ask copilot) âœ…
- Add prefstoggle âœ…
- Transfer doc, and clean up ðŸ‘ˆ
- Improve comments with copilot
- Improve readme (copilot)
- Make sure comments are max 80 char wide etc
- Make things public
- Add the accessIDs
- Integrate in main project ðŸ”¥ Add it to SideBarContainer that has models, callbacks, etc
- Make gif
- Add a way to customize metrics a bit. paddings, offsets etc

## Not-todo:
- Add optional sidebar toggle button at the top ðŸš« (we can put that elsewhere?)
- add example proj with bidnings etc or? ðŸš« (preview is fine for now)
- simulating change with dispatch etc (maybe) ðŸš« (not needed it will work)

## Future considerations:
- Implement toggle compact-mode / expanded-mode functionality etc, or not? at least wait and do it later when things are ðŸ‘‰ more stable ðŸ‘ˆ etc (align icons to support compact mode)
