/**
 * MenuView for `mac` and `iPad` ("SideBar")
 * - Abstract: This is the main menu view for the sidebar. It is a list of menu items that are displayed in the sidebar.
 * - Description: This view serves as the primary navigation panel, allowing 
 *                users to access different sections of the application 
 *                through a sidebar interface.
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Model has the action callback
 * - Note: We embed stack in a vscroll because List is very tricky to style across OSes
 * - Note: Sections should be minimizable
 * - Note: Use style modifiers as much as possible
 * - Note: The model create groups
 * - Note: Alternative name: üëâüëâ `SideBarMenuView` ? üëàüëà Rename to this because, menu can be popover menu and all sorts of other menues, sidebarmenu is more speccific `SideBarView`
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Rename to SideBar? or SideBarView? Check with copilot etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Only show sidebar tags for rows that has more than zero, maybe?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Remove down state for buttons in macOS and for iPad? `configuration.isPressed`

    * - Description: This is toggled from the Button action, and trigered 
    *               in a callback defind in the model
    * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è The state is located in the caller of this view
    * - Note: When this is changed, the main/detail views change
    * - Note: For more code on selected binding, see device-picker
    * - Note: if animation carries over to presenting main / detail, use: `.animation(nil)` // Disable animation for this Text view
    * - Note: to reach this from parent we can inject a rebinder
    * - Note: We use UUID. because int index is less suitable across groups etc
    * - Note: UUID's for items change on each init etc
    * - Note: can be nil, for instance in compact mode for ipad etc
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Make this optional etc or?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è If we want to isolate anim on just text, we could, use onChange and wrap withAnim in tht call etc or somet other solution? or is this done now?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è UUID's change when view refreshes. instead use combined col:row index. ask copilot to make a suggested design. maybe use hashable and identifiable etc?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è add note about CombinedIndex. Equatable etc?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe make selection: UUID ? (that works in multi-dimensional setup etc)
